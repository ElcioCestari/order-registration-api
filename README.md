# order-registration-api

This  project is the backend to [order-registration-front](https://github.com/ElcioCestari/order-registration-frontend) where I'm developing a software like an e-commerce. <br>
The intention is put in practice my studies, it's not for to be commercial.
<br>

## Technologies

Some of the main technologies are:

* database: **MongoDB**
* cache: **Redis**

## How to Run

I'm still working in this but in summary you will need run containers to **MongoDB** and **Redis**
see the application-properties.yml file to know which data you will need to add.

If you wanna talk about something send me a email **elciotaira@gmail.com** with the subject **ORDER-REGISTRATION-API**
